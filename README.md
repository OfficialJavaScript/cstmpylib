The rules of the files used here are simple, you can use the code in any of your programs, if it's possible to mention in a README file, or if used in a game as a thanks, but it's not mandatory. My comment "# Programmed by @OfficialJavaScript on GitHub" mustn't be removed.

Even if you modify the code, you must keep my comment at the top.
